Crawling ptt

Special thanks to [wy36101299](https://github.com/wy36101299/PTTcrawler) for making the ptt crawler

## ptt_crawler.py
Modified the original ptt_crawler.py to fit my needs.

## pttquery.html
This is the place where data get fetched by ajax. All data are located in [ptt-crawler-indexer/data/](https://github.com/billcccheng/ptt-crawler-indexer/tree/master/data). This file here is just for people who are interest on how I wrote this ptt searching web application. Note: You have to push this file to a http server for it to run, however you can run it locally to test it. <br><br>
**I will try to keep the updated version with the production I have in my personal webpage private repo.**
